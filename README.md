# Final Assignment (2022)

A few notes about this assignment:

- this assignment is a pure fictional assignment in which I created my portfolio website;
- the main goal is to implement html & css fundamentals;
- the index.html layout was given by the schoolteacher (without code) and I had to develop the markup & styling myself;
- I was free to fill in the interpretation of the other html-files;
- this assignment is in Dutch, because it is my native language and I followed this course in Dutch;
- contact form doesn't send data to a server.
